My name is Santigo, I'm from Cuba but I am living in Spain. I'm a scientific researcher and PhD student.

* Currently working at [CEIT](https://ceit.es) as a scientific researcher.
* I also work as a visiting professor at [TECNUN](https://tecnun.unav.edu/), [University of Navarra](https://www.unav.edu/).
* I have started an internship in the [Linux Foundation's mentorship program](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/d8a154c6-41fb-4733-b3c8-df37796e7fa3).
